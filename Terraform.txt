Ex:-- 
Create a user testuser. 
Create a group newadmins. 
Make testuser member of newadmins.
Assign administrative previlege to newadmins group. 

# This is my first ever Terraform script
provider "aws" {

         access_key = "AKIAJYXAL24GXOHWLLRA"
         secret_key = "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"
         region     = "us-east-2"

}

resource "aws_iam_user" "Creatingnewuser" {
           name = "testuser"
}

  group      = "newadmins"
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess"
}



Ex 2: Create a new directory at your root home exc1. set up terraform with provider aws. ti should create a s3 bucket in us-east-1 region

provider "aws" {

         access_key = "AKIAJYXAL24GXOHWLLRA"
         secret_key = "b4+ZDGVINmLBtCIcuD+jZDRhWnMBkX+W9/FCbKO/"
         region     = "us-east-2"

}
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "newbucket" {
  bucket = "logifirstbucket"
   region = "us-east-1"
}



Ex 3: Create an instance 
# This is my first ever Terraform script

variable "regionofoperation" {
  default = "us-east-2"
}

variable "myami" {
  default = "ami-0b59bfac6be064b78"
}

variable "instancetype" {}

provider "aws" {
  access_key = "AKIAJYXAL24GXOHWLLRA"
  secret_key = "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"
  region     = "${var.regionofoperation}"
}

resource "aws-instance" "firstone" {
  ami           = "${var.myami}"
  instance_type = "${var.instancetype}"
}



Ex:-- 
Create a new vpc with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16. 
Create two subnets in it with CIDR 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24. 
Make one of the subnets public subnet and keep of the subnet as private subnet. 
Create a security group allowing port 80.
